# ssh-copy-redit - Remote Editor Installer #
**Script to copy and configure remote editing with TextMate and Sublime Text.**

Remote text editor setup based upon [ssh-copy-rmate](https://gist.github.com/leon/1965146) and [ssh-copy-rsub](https://gist.github.com/leon/1957476) by [Leon Radley](https://github.com/leon).

Both do basically the same thing, but have separate directions for [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) and [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). So I am merging them into a single script **ssh-copy-redit**.
